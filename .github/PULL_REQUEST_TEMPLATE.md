## Remark for PR creator

- Justfile is a task runner for the command line interface that allows you to run shell commands from a file named `justfile` in your project directory. You can use Justfile after [installing it](https://github.com/casey/just). Note that commands written in `justfile` of this repository are expected to be run in `bash`, not `cmd` or `powershell`. Running `just ...` commands in `cmd` or `powershell` will produce errors as the syntax is not compatible. On Windows, you can use `git bash` if you have Git installed.
