# Overview

During the two years, I have not seen people saying flutter_rust_bridge is too slow when they use it.
**If you find it too slow for your scenario, don't hesitate to open an issue!**

That said, I have done some benchmarking,
and they are continuously evaluated for each commit via the CI.
The dashboard page contains some tabular data,
and the raw visualization page contains full plots for each benchmark.

The current benchmarks are quite coarse,
and serves mainly as a rough reference instead of a multiple-digit super accurate report.

I may work on improving performance later (after v2 is published),
and write more detailed information in this page.
