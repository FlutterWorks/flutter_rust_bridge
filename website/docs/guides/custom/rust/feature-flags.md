# Feature flags

The full list of feature flags can be seen [here](https://docs.rs/crate/flutter_rust_bridge/latest/features)
(you may need to switch to corresponding version).

For example, suppose you need to use `chrono` types, then add that feature flag.
As another example, suppose you never use async code, then the `rust-async` feature flag can be removed.
