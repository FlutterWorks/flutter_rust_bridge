# Directory structure (multi-file)

:::info
This page is about the directory generated by `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen create/integrate`.
You are free to use whatever other methods to integrate Rust with Dart.

## Overview

import DirectoryStructureBriefExplain from '../../snippets/_directory-structure-brief-explain.mdx';
import DirectoryStructureBriefList from '../../snippets/_directory-structure-brief-list.mdx';

<DirectoryStructureBriefExplain/>

Briefly speaking, the folders are:

<DirectoryStructureBriefList/>

## Details

Firstly, everything in this section only applies to the default template as a starter kit.
You are surely free to customize everything, use your own template, etc,
and flutter_rust_bridge continues to work well.

As mentioned above, a good starting point to write code is `lib/main.dart` and `rust/src/api/simple.rs`.
Suppose we want to add more files:

* For Dart, write anywhere in `lib` (the recommended place is inside `lib/src`).
* For Rust, write anywhere in `rust/src/api`.

Remark: When adding a Rust file, remember to add it as a module in `mod.rs`.
Otherwise, Rust (and flutter_rust_bridge) will act as if your file does not exist at all.
For example, after creating `rust/src/api/another.rs`,
we need to add a line `pub mod another;` inside `rust/src/api/mod.rs`.

## Remarks

If you are interested:
The `rust_builder` dummy package is likely to be able to be removed
after the Dart "native assets" language feature is stabilized,
which acts as a build hook similar to `build.dart` in the "native assets" feature.
