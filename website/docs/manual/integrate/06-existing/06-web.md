# Integrating with Web

Refer to the [Web setup](../template/setup/web) page for required installables.

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you will need to create a wrapper
to consume the bridge files. In the case of `DynamicLibrary`
you only needed to supply the path to the binary,
but to import a WASM module you need to:

- Create a script tag to the JS file generated by `wasm_bindgen` and insert it into the document;
- Invoke the `wasmModule` initializer defined in the
  web bridge;
- And finally, create the implementation class.

Create a Dart file and copy these lines to it:

```dart
import 'bridge_generated.web.dart';
export 'bridge_definitions.dart';

import 'dart:html';

// Path to the wasm_bindgen generated files
const root = 'pkg/native';
final api = NativeImpl.wasm(WasmModule.initialize(
    kind: const Modules.noModules(root: root),
));
```
