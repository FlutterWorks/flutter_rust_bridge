# Async in Rust

Currently, this feature has not been supported yet. However, it is implementable and the flutter_rust_bridge barely has assumption that user Rust functions should be sync. Issue [#966](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/issues/966) has some discussions about how to implement it.

[This](../article/async_in_rust.md) older article also describes some workarounds, which may be useful before the function is implemented.
